</center><br>

We want to do more and you can help. By committing a small fraction of your income to protect children in need, you can help save a child and contribute to humanity. You can donate as low as INR 500 per month.

While Save the Children appreciates monthly donations where you choose to donate a small fixed amount monthly for us to be able to plan our programmes for a longer term, a single donation can also help save a child.

You will get your tax exemption certificate within 15 days of your one-time donation (quarterly in case of regular donors, who pledge monthly donations, after their first monthâ€™s donation). You will get quarterly updates on how you are making a difference.</h2>
